This repository contains scripts I used to perform the block-size
benchmark described here (and in the following articles):

  http://www.fuzzy.cz/en/articles/filesystem-vs-postgresql-block-size/
  http://www.fuzzy.cz/en/articles/results-of-the-block-size-benchmark-for-hdd-introduction/

You may use it to check how the benchmark was actually performed, to
understand the results or repeat the benchmark on your own (possibly
on a different hardware).
